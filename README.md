This is my Web Developer Resume, built in plain HTML with zero added frameworks. 
Fully responsive on all viewports; the multi-column format automatically resizes for mobile and tablet devices.

Page includes links for my Portfolio site, Email, LinkedIn, Github, and a printable resume in PDF format.
